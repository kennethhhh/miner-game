Why I left these these methods in the functions class?
1. processLine()

This method simply goes through a string, separates them, and based on that, it does something. It doesn't really relate to the game
objects. I believe this function has to do with gaia.sav

2. parseBackground(), parseMiner(), parseObstacle(), etc.

These methods make sure that the length of the list of strings matches the corresponding property attribute. For example for 
parseBackground(), it checks to make sure that the input list length with BGND_NUM_PROPERTIES (4). If it does, the method does something
returns true or false. These methods don't have much to do with the game objects, but more with the given file.

3. createBlacksmith(), createMinerFull(), createMinerNotFull(), etc.

I left these methods in the functions class because it would be weird to have an object creating itself. It is possible to move each
create method into its corresponding class. Below is a comparison of leaving it in functions and moving it into its corresponding class.


CORRESPONDING CLASS
MinerFull m = new MinerFull()
m.createMinerFull

VS

LEAVING IT IN FUNCTIONS CLASS
MinerFull m = functions.createMinerFull()
