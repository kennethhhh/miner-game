1. 
The first click will spawn a building (which is a background so entities can walk over the building) and a new entity at the door of 
the building (the new entity is called Sakura). Every click after the first click will create a black hole background(1x1).


2. 
Building: Any miners/oreblobs will turn into Sakuras if they are within 5 tiles of the click (in other words,11x11 where the middle of 
the 11x11 is the mouse click). Every 5 seconds after the intial click, the door of the building will spawn a new Sakura. 

Blackhole: The blackhole removes the entity at the mouse click (if no entity, just changes the background to a blackhole) and 3 seconds 
after will change the blackhole into grass. If the user clicks the cell that spawns Sakura, the building will stop spawning Sakura.


3.
Sakura: Sakura will look for oreblobs and veins and destroy them.


4.
The new entities include Sakura and Sasuke. Sakura's behavior and how she is spawns is described above. When miners get 2 ores and turn it
in to a blacksmith, they turn into Sasuke. Sasuke looks for Sakura and kills her. If Sakura is not present, Sasuke will target oreblobs.


EXTRA: 
After the first click, a song will play in the background.
